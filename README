===========

   This package provides a server for locks and a package for clients

locks on a Internet wide bases, solving critical section problems
without the mess of NFS or other file locking techniques.

   For example:

       my $lock = IPC::Locker->lock(host=>'example.std.com');
       ... Critical section ...
       $lock->unlock();
